# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog. This is a sample post to demonstrate the markdown capabilities.

## Features

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists like this one
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more!

## Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

2. Photography
3. Personal projects

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
