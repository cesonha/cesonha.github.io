## Project Overview

This personal website is designed to be a clean, sober, and professional representation of your online presence. It features:

- An About section for personal information
- A Blog section with markdown support
- A Photos section with album organization
- Social media links
- Dark mode design with red accents

The site is built as a static website, making it fast, secure, and easy to host on platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework: Next.js

Next.js was chosen for this project for several key reasons:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates HTML at build time for optimal performance
- **File-based routing**: Simplifies navigation structure
- **React-based**: Leverages component-based architecture for maintainability
- **Built-in optimization**: Image optimization, code splitting, and more
- **Easy deployment**: Works well with GitHub Pages and other hosting services

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS provides:

- Utility-first approach for consistent styling
- Responsive design capabilities out of the box
- Dark mode support
- Typography plugin for rich text formatting
- Easy customization through the configuration file

### Content Management

The site uses a file-based content management approach:

- **Blog posts**: Markdown files with frontmatter (using gray-matter)
- **Photo albums**: JSON configuration files
- **Images**: Stored in the public directory

This approach eliminates the need for a database while maintaining flexibility.

## Content Management

### Adding Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored as markdown files in the `content/posts` directory. To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `content/posts` directory
2. Name the file with a unique identifier (e.g., `my-new-post.md`)
3. Add frontmatter at the top of the file with the following format:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

Your markdown content here...
```

4. Write your content using markdown syntax
5. Save the file and rebuild the site

Example blog post structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Getting Started with Next.js"
date: "2024-05-30"
excerpt: "Learn how to build a website with Next.js"
tags: ["nextjs", "react", "tutorial"]
---

# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications...

## Installation

First, create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

...and so on
```

### Adding Photo Albums

Photo albums are configured using JSON files in the `content/albums` directory. To add a new album:

1. Add your photos to a new directory in `public/images/photos/[album-name]/`
2. Create a new JSON file in the `content/albums` directory (e.g., `my-album.json`)
3. Configure the album with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Album Title",
  "description": "Description of the album",
  "coverImage": "/images/photos/[album-name]/cover.jpg",
  "photos": [
    {
      "src": "/images/photos/[album-name]/photo1.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption for photo 1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/images/photos/[album-name]/photo2.jpg",
      "caption": "Caption for photo 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

4. Save the file and rebuild the site

Important notes about photos:
- Use optimized images (compress them before adding)
- Recommended image dimensions: 1200×800 pixels for consistency
- Use descriptive captions to enhance the viewing experience
- The `coverImage` will be displayed on the albums index page

## Styling and Theming

The website uses a dark theme with red accents. The main color scheme is defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

- Primary color: Red (#EF4444)
- Accent color: Orange (#F97316)
- Background: Dark gray (#111827)

To modify the theme:

1. Edit the color definitions in `tailwind.config.js`
2. Adjust the prose styling in the typography section
3. Update any specific color classes in `styles/globals.css`

## Deployment

The website is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. Push changes to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds the site
3. The built site is deployed to the gh-pages branch
4. The site is available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/`

For custom domains:
1. Add your domain in the GitHub repository settings
2. Create a CNAME file in the `public` directory with your domain name
3. Configure your DNS settings as per GitHub's instructions

## Extending the Website

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section to the website:

1. Create a new page in the `pages` directory
2. Add the route to the navigation in `components/Navbar.js`
3. Implement the page content using existing components and styles

### Adding New Features

The modular nature of Next.js and React makes it easy to extend the website:

- Add new React components in the `components` directory
- Create new utility functions in the `lib` directory
- Install additional packages as needed with `npm install`

### Performance Optimization

The static generation approach already provides excellent performance, but you can further optimize:

- Use responsive images with appropriate sizes
- Minimize JavaScript with production builds
- Utilize Next.js's built-in performance features
